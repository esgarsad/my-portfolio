# my-portfolio

My portfolio is just that, a portfolio that shows  what I have developed so far, it is an interactive site where you will find every project tagged with a short description of it; you will be sent to the site when clicked.
## Find it

You can see my whole portfolio [here](https://esgarsad.github.io/my-portfolio/).

## Notes about my porfolio

Some projects actually don't exist so far and will take you to a google site. My portfolio will be updated every week!
